# Arithmetic Operators
a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)  # Addition: 15
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 5
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 50
print(a / b)  # Division: 2.0
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 0
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 100000
print(a // b) # Floor Division: 2
  
# Assignment Operators
a += 3  # a = a + 3
print(a)  # Output: 13

# Comparison Operators
print(a == b)  # Equal: False
print(a != b)  # Not equal: True
print(a > b)   # Greater than: True
print(a < b)   # Less than: False
print(a >= b)  # Greater than or equal to: True
print(a <= b)  # Less than or equal to: False

# Logical Operators
x = True
y = False
print(x and y)  # Logical AND: False
print(x or y)   # Logical OR: True
print(not x)    # Logical NOT: False

# Bitwise Operators
print(a & b)  # Bitwise AND: 5
print(a | b)  # Bitwise OR: 13
print(a ^ b)  # Bitwise XOR: 8
print(~a)     # Bitwise NOT: -14
print(a << 1) # Bitwise left shift: 26
print(a >> 1) # Bitwise right shift: 6

# Identity Operators
print(a is b)  # Identity: False
print(a is not b)  # Identity: True

# Membership Operators
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(3 in my_list)  # Membership: True
print(6 not in my_list)  # Membership: True
